# Social Media API - John Zigterman

## Description

- For this project I set out to create a flexible and efficient API backend for a generic social media service.
- This backend allows the user to establish users, thoughts that the users can post, and reactions to those thoughts as objects that are all interrelated.
- For now, this project is just a backend. It requires the use of Insomnia or another API querying program.
- This project is set up to be easy to use on a locally hosted setup for development and testing.

## Installation

The user may install all of the necessary npm packages by typing 'npm i' in the console. This will set the program up for success.

## Usage

For the backend to be effective, the user must start the server using 'npm start' and then make requests to it using Insomnia or other means, following the requirements for JSON data when applicable, as in put and post requests.

## Credits

I, John Paul Zigterman, completed this project by myself with the aid of the resources provided to me by the MSU coding bootcamp.
